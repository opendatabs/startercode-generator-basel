# Starter code for all datasets of the Canton of Basel-Stadt


üí° Have you ever **wished to be able to open any dataset in a data portal with one click and get a fully configured Python or R Markdown file? Like ‚Äì with all metadata, descriptions, data links, and some starter code?** 

This is an experiment to provide exactly this. 

With this repo you get starter code for **all datasets** (currently {{ DATASET_COUNT }}) that are available in the [open data portal of the canton of Basel-Stadt](https://data.bs.ch). 

In the list below you find links to preconfigured code files so that you **immediately can start analyzing the data with R or Python.**

<!-- **The Jupyter Notebooks can be opened directly in Google Colab.** üöÄ -->

Feedback is always very welcome ‚Äì simply open an issue or write to üìß [opendata@bs.ch](mailto://opendata@bs.ch)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: To download individual files from GitHub you need to switch to the file's `RAW` view and then `Right-Click-Save-As`. Only so you get the proper file format rather than the HTML that GitHub yields.

For all data licenses please refer to each data set's link or the metadata API endpoint provided [here](https://www.opendata.bs.ch/nutzungsbedingungen.html).

üåª Our thanks for the template and help goes to Patrick Arnecke from the Statistical Office of the Canton of Zurich. Here is the original:
